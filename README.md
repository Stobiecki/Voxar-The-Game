# Voxar - When The Sky Goes Dark

# Shortly about the game
First-person, 3D game focused on exploration. Initially made for one of my *3D programming* classes, but vastly expanded on the basic premis of the game. This game was my first *real* try of game-dev experience.Â 

I put a lot of thought into this project, so I hope the person playing this game will enjoy it. :relaxed:

Game was written in C++ with GLSL shaders for OpenGL API. The whole engine for this game was implemented solely by myself and can *technically* be expended on.

The game itself contains a debug window that was disabled for the players sake and experience (it can still be compiled with the toggling option enabled and triggered in the game, if needed).

# Lore
You are put in this weird land called *Voxar*. Where exactly is it? Who are you? No one knows... The only way for you to know is to investigate into the land itself to find answers, as it is the only way to find the answeres.

# Contols
W, A, S, D - Movement\
Shift      - Running (press the direction, press and hold shift, release the direction button)\
H          - Toggle dithering effect (the game is intended to play with this setting on, but it can be unpleasant to look at for some, so this graphic effect can be disabled)\
M          - Debug window (disabled in release version)

Thans to anyone that whould like to try my first game. I hope you liked it :smile:
